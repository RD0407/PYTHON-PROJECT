# Image Sharpening Batch Script

A simple Python project to batch-sharpen all images in a folder and save the results to a new directory. 
Useful for quickly improving image clarity for many files at once.
Features

    Batch Processing: Automatically processes all images in a chosen folder.

    Image Sharpening: Applies a sharpening filter to each image to enhance clarity.

    Easy to Use: Just place your images in the imgs/ folder and run the script.

    Safe Output: Saves all results into a new folder called editedImgs/ to keep originals untouched.


## How to Use

    Put your images (e.g. .png, .jpg) into the imgs/ folder (create it if it doesnâ€™t exist).

    Make sure you have the required packages installed:

pip install pillow

Run the script:

    python script_name.py

    Check your edited images in the editedImgs/ folder.
    All edited files will have _edited appended to the original name.

Requirements

    Python 3.x

    Pillow (pip install pillow)
